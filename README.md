run_analysis.R
The included R script, run_analysis.R, conducts the following:
Read both the train and test datasets and merge them into x_total, y_total and sub_total, respectively.
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set and appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
From the data sets in previous step, a second data set is created which is a independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
Finally the result is shown in the file tidy_dataset.txt.

CodeBook.md
A code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work performed to clean up the data
